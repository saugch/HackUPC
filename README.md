# Some short notes about this code
This code provides the user with an easy interface that allows them to choose the following parameters: city of origin, city(cities) of destination, dates in between which you can travel, number of days you want to stay abroad, number of travellers and maximum budget. The application returns different combinations of flights and hotels, taking into account the cost of living. They are ordered according to your preferences (if the user provides an ordered list of destinations) and always fit your budgets. The applications shows by default only three results, but the users are able to continue looking into the possibilities for the same city or skip to the next destination of their choice.
